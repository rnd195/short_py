# Short Python Scripts

This is a collection of relatively simple Python scripts that I have put together as I was learning the language.

### `bubble_sort_alg.py`

- an implementation of the *Bubble sort* algorithm



### `insert_sort_alg.py`

- an implementation of the *Insertion sort* algorithm



### `stat_median.py`

- finding the median of an unsorted sequence of real numbers



### `data_manip.py`

- a script that is used to import and export text files for the 3 aforementioned programs



### `caesar_cipher.py`

- an implementation of the Caesar cipher encryption technique (also decryption)
